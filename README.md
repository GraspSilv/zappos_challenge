Coding challenge for Zappos, due October 2, 11:59 pm.

To run:
python zapposgui.py

Necessary packages:
requests (sudo pip install requests)

At time of submission, I hadn't been able to implement as much as I'd like. I was unable to find a suitable image library in time, and so could not include product images in my gui. The gui itself was implemented hastily, to say the least. I also wish my searching/grouping algorithm were more refined and foolproof, but that's the way it is.
